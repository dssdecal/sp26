    "content": "Course Overview . Welcome to the Data Science Society at Berkeley’s very own DeCal: Introduction to Real World Data Science, a semester-long course designed to equip students with essential data science skills through hands-on, project-based learning. Our program takes a departure from the traditional classroom setting, empowering members to work collaboratively on an original data science project of their choosing, giving them full creative control. Throughout the course, students will receive mentorship from our Decal’s committee members. We will cover every stage of the data science lifecycle – from formulating a data-centric project proposal, to discovering insights through exploratory data analysis, and concluding with the engineering and evaluation of machine learning models. This introductory course covers a wide variety of data science concepts, including topics both traditionally and not traditionally taught in the lecture halls of Berkeley. We aim to equip students with programming expertise, through engaging lessons that mirror the data science lifecycle. As students progress, they will directly apply these concepts in their own projects, gaining first-hand experience with each stage of their project’s lifecycle. In this course, students will not only develop and refine their technical skills, but also learn from real-world data scientists through panels and speaker events. Data 198: Introduction to Real World Data Science will challenge students and prepare them in the search for post-graduate opportunities, all while maintaining the low-pressure environment of a DeCal that prioritizes learning above all else. Learning Outcomes . | Understand the data science lifecycle and develop core skills in data manipulation, visualization, model development, and model evaluation to make predictions and answer real-world questions. | Synthesize data science concepts and apply them collaboratively in industry settings. | Develop the ability to communicate complex data-based procedures and findings to academic peers. | Understand how to ideate an original project based on personal curiosity and data collection. | . This course is a 2-unit, application-based P/NP class designed as a hands-on supplement for those interested in learning data science at UC Berkeley. Emphasizing concepts that require minimal prior knowledge, the course will guide students through a data science project (undergoing the entire data science lifecycle) which will help you build up your portfolio. Grading is based on the satisfactory completion of this project, with a few additional checkpoints and weekly mini-vitamins to reinforce learning. Prerequisites . The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students who have not previously taken computer science, and data science courses. Students with some prior experience in computing are welcome to enroll, and often find that this course offers a new perspective that blends computational and inferential thinking. Students who have taken several statistics or computer science courses should instead take a more advanced course like Data 100. Support . You are not alone in this DATA 198: Introduction to Real World Data Science the staff and instructors are here to support you as you learn the material. It’s expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. Your TA and tutor will be your main point of contact for all course related questions/grade clarifications. The TAs and tutors are here to support you so please lean on your TA/Tutor if you need more support in the class or have any questions/concerns. Important Note: We don’t use any personal or Berkeley emails to handle Decal logistics or requests. Any emails of this form to Facilitator’s or TA’swill be disregarded. | For personal inquiries during the semester, please message your TA on private messaging platforms or their personal Berkeley email. | For inquiries before or after the semester, email dss.data198@gmail.com | .

Data Types . | Data Type | Description | Examples | . | int | Represents integers: whole numbers that are positive or negative. | 42, -100, 0 | . | float | Represents decimal numbers (floating-point). | 3.14, -1.23, 0.0 | . | str | Represents text (strings of characters). | \"Hello\", 'Data' | . | bool | Represents boolean values (True or False). | True, False | . Arithmetic Operators . | Numeric Expression | Description | Examples | . | Addition (+) | Adds two numbers together. | 2 + 3 would return 5 x + 10 adds 10 to the value of x | . | Subtraction (-) | Subtracts the second number from the first. | 5 - 2 would return 3 x - 4 subtracts 4 from x | . | Multiplication (*) | Multiplies two numbers. | 3 * 4 would return 12 x * 2 multiplies x by 2 | . | Division (/) | Divides the first number by the second, returns a floating-point result. | 10 / 2 would return 5.0 x / 4 divides x by 4 | . | Floor Division (//) | Divides the first number by the second, rounds down to the nearest integer. | 10 // 3 would return 3 x // 2 divides x and rounds down | . | Modulus (%) | Returns the remainder of dividing the first number by the second. | 10 % 3 would return 1 x % 2 checks if x is even or odd (remainder) | . | Exponentiation (**) | Raises the first number to the power of the second number. | 2 ** 3 would return 8 x ** 2 squares x | . | Unary Negation (-) | Returns the negative of the number. | -x returns the negative of x -10 would return -10 | . Variables and Expressions . | Concept | Description | Examples | . | Expression | Any combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a value. | 2 + 3, x * 10, len('hello') | . | Variable | A name that refers to a value or an expression result. Can be reassigned to different values. | x = 10 name = \"Sid\" | . | Assignment | The process of assigning a value to a variable using the = operator. | age = 25 assigns the value of 25 to the variable age total = price * quantity sets the total variable equal to the product of the values in the price and quantity variable | . | Arithmetic Expression | An expression involving arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **, //). | a + b, 3 * 4, 10 / 2, 2 ** 3 | . | Comparison Expression | An expression that compares two values using operators (==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=), and returns either True or False | a == b check the equivalency of a and b 5 &gt; 3 will return True x != y checks if x is not equal to y, returning True if it is not | . | String Expression | An expression that manipulates strings with operators like + for concatenation or * for repetition. | \"Hello\" + \" World\", \"a\" * 3 | . | Variable Reference | Referring to a variable in an expression to use its value. | x * 5 would return the value of x times 5 count - 1 would return the value of count minus 1 | . | Compound Expression | A combination of multiple expressions into one, possibly using parentheses for grouping. | (a + b) * 3 | .
