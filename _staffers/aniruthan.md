bio: Hello everyone! I’m Ani, a second year student studying data science but also interested in cognitive science and economics. This is my first semester in Academic Development but I took the DeCal last semester. Apart from school, I enjoy hiking, playing/watching sports (basketball, football, skiing. snowboarding) and video games. I’m looking forward to meeting everyone throughout this semester!
