bio: Hiii! I’m Yara, one of the Directors of Aacdev this semester!! This is my third semester in DSS and I actually took this DeCal my freshman fall. :) I’m a junior, double majoring in Data Science and Environmental Economics & Policy. Originally, I’m from Egypt, but I grew up in the East Bay, in the small town of Martinez. I love cooking, word hunt, digi pics, napping, bowling, Costco runs, watching Suits, and exploring new places. I am so excited to meet you all and for a great semester!
