bio: Hi I’m Michelle! I'm a junior from San Diego studying Data Science. I'm a former DeCal student and now I'm super excited to be on Academic Development Committee! I love trying new food spots with friends, watching sunsets, painting, reading (my fav genres are dystopian/fantasy), and grocery shopping (I love hoarding Costco samples). Can't wait to meet everyone :)
