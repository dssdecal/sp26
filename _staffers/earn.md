bio:  Hellooo, I'm Rinrada or Earn (call me whichever) and I'm a junior majoring in Data Science. Originally from Thailand, but I live in LA now. I took the DeCal in Sp25, and really enjoyed the hands-on experience. I LOVE matcha, journaling, photography, watching movies/TV shows, and shopping! I'm so excited to be working with everyone :)
